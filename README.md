# Wordle Terminal
[View the live project here] (https://github.com/marko042/wordle-terminal.git)

This project represents a modified clone of the popular online game Wordle.
Your challenge is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. Each time you guess, you're told which of your chosen letters are in the target word, and whether they are in the right place. And that's it.

# Project goals

 This project main idea is to entertain the players who are fans and engage the ones who are not yet familiar with this viral phenomenon that started bach in 2022.

# User experience

 - Main purpose:

    Build an easy app for the users to play the game.
    Build a game that is both enjoyable and challenging for the players.

    As a new visitor, I want to:

    Be able to understand the purpose of the App and start a new game.
    Be able to follow the score, see the wrong and right letters appear once I take a turn, and see how many tries remain before the game is over.
    

    As a returning visitor, I want to:

    Be able to play the game again with a different word as chosen by the computer.
    Be challenged and try to improve on my previous scores.

      ## Technologies Used
      - Languages Used
        - Python

      - Python Packages

   -  Random: returns a random integer to get a random word
   -  sys: It allows us to access parameters and functionalities specific to the terminal

      ## Frameworks - Libraries - Programs Used

         Git
         - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push to GitHub
         GitHub
         - GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git
         Heroku
         - Heroku was used to deploy the live project
         Lucidchart
         - Lucidchart was used to create the flowchart

         - List of random 5 letter words is pulled from a txt file I created.


      # Testing

      Testing was performed to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

      ## Validator Testing

      - PEP8  Validator Service was used to validate every Python file in the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. [pep8ci](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
       - Lines to long errors found and fixed, but invalid escape sequence to my knowledge was present because of the use of backslash sign  in the logo
