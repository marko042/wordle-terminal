# Wordle Terminal
[View the live project here] (https://github.com/marko042/wordle-terminal.git)

This project represents a modified clone of the popular online game Wordle.
Your challenge is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. Each time you guess, you're told which of your chosen letters are in the target word, and whether they are in the right place. And that's it.

# Project goals

 This project main idea is to entertain the players who are fans and engage the ones who are not yet familiar with this viral phenomenon that started bach in 2022.

 # User experience


    Main purpose:

    Build an easy app for the users to play the game.
    Build a game that is both enjoyable and challenging for the players.

    As a new visitor, I want to:

    Be able to understand the purpose of the App and start a new game.
    Be able to follow the score, see the wrong and right letters appear once I take a turn, and see how many tries remain before the game is over.
    

    As a returning visitor, I want to:

    Be able to play the game again with a different word as chosen by the computer.
    Be challenged and try to improve on my previous scores.
